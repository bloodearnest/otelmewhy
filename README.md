# PyCon UK 2025 OpenTelemetry workshop

This is the repo for the workshop. It contains some simple django applications
that we will use to learn how to configure and use opentelemetry.

It requires [uv]() and [just]() to be able to run.

## How to get set up

### Github Codespaces

If you start a codespace, everything should be pre-installed and ready to. To test everything is working, enter

```
just run
```

in the vscode terminal, and TODO: ports


### VSCode

Like Codespaces, you can use devcontainers to run a pre-build docker image with everything installed and ready to go

```
just run
```

### On your machine

You will need to install uv and just. On windows, you will also need one of Git for Windows, Github Desktop, or CYGWIN.


```
just migrate
just run
```
